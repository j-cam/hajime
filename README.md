# hajime [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/j-cam/hajime-boilerplate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/j-cam/hajime-boilerplate)

A boilerplate/toolkit that makes use of Gulp, PostCSS, and Nunjucks to help get new front-end projects up and running quickly. 

## Setup

Clone the repo by running `git clone https://github.com/j-cam/hajime-boilerplate.git project-name` where `project-name` is the name of your project.
Run `npm install` then run `gulp` from inside the project folder you just created.

## Tasks 

Gulp tasks are setup as individual files to make editing and adding files less of a headache. There is a tasks.config.json file for
configuring input and output paths for each task.
