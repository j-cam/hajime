# hajime

A gulpified tool to help begin front-end production sooner.

## Setup

Clone the repo by running `git clone https://github.com/j-cam/hajime-boilerplate.git project-name` where `project-name` is the name of your project.
Run `npm install` then run `gulp` from inside the project folder you just created.

## Todos

- Flesh out the readme...
- Trim fat from SASS
- Browserify might be overkill
